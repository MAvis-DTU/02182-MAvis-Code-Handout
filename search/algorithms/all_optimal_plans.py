    In order to represent the nodes of a solution graph, we need to track
    additional information beyond that contained in the State class.
    For this reason, we here provide a wrapper class you can use for your
    ALL_OPTIMAL_PLANS search.

    More precisely, it provides the following additional members:
    - parents: A list of parents such that we can support each node having
    multiple parents
    - actions: A list of all possible actions from this state.
    - optimal_actions_and_results: A map of actions into their resulting
    MultiParentNode. Note that these actions should be the subset of all
    possible actions, which occurs on some optimal plan.
    - consistent_goals: A set of GoalDescriptions which can contain the goal
    labelling.

    The implemented methods assume that the state only contains a single agent,
    but feel free to extend this to also support the multi-agent case if you
    so desire.
