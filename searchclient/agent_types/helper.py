def helper_agent_type(level, initial_state, action_library, goal_description, frontier):

    # Here you should implement the HELPER-AGENT algorithm.
    # Some tips are:
    # - From goal_description, you should look into color_filter and get_sub_goal to create monochrome and subgoal problems.
    # - You should handle communication with the server yourself and check successes of joint actions.
    #   Look into classic.py to see how this is done.
    # - You can create an action set where only a specific agent is allowed to move as follows:
    #   action_set = [[GenericNoOp()]] * level.num_agents
    #   action_set[agent_index] = action_library
    # - You probably want to create a helper function for creating the set of negative obstacle subgoals.
    #   You can then create a new goal description using 'goal_description.create_new_goal_description_of_same_type'
    #   which takes a list of subgoals.
