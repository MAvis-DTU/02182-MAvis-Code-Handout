Using the robot agent type differs from previous agent types.
  - Firstly, install additional package 'msgpack'.
    Use pip for installation, like this: 
        'python -m pip install numpy msgpack'. 
    Exact steps may vary based on your platform and Python 
    installation. 
  - Secondly, you don't need the Java server for the robot. So, the command
    to start the search client in the terminal is different, for example:
        'python searchclient/searchclient.py -robot -ip 192.168.0.102 -level levels/SAsoko1_04.lvl'
    runs the searchclient with the 'robot' agent type on the robot at IP 192.168.0.102. See a
    list of robot IPs at the github page for the course.
  - To connect to the robots, connect to the Pepper hotspot. To reduce
    the load on the hotspot, please disconnect between your sessions.
    
  - A good starting point is using something similar to the 'classic' agent type and then
    replacing it with calls to the 'robot' interface.
