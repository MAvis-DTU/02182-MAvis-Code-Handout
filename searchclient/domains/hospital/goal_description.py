class HospitalGoalDescription:

    A goal description is simple a list of goal literals where each literal is a triplet on
    the form (position, character, is_positive). Is_positive is used to denote how this goal is satisfied, with a
    positive goal being satisfied when an object with the matching character is at the goal position, while a
    negative goal is satisfied when such an object is *not* at the goal position.
    The 'goal' member contains all goals (both agent and box goals) while 'agent_goal' and 'box_goal' only
    contains one kind. This double representation allows for quick and convenient lookup of goals of a specific kind
