    The Level class stores all information loaded from the level file in a convenient format.
    - Walls are stored as a two-dimensional row-major array of booleans, i.e. walls[row][col] is True iff
      there is a wall at (row, col)
    - Colors is a map from characters into a color string. I.e. if box A is red then colors['A'] = "red".
      Note that this map stores the colors of both agents and boxes
    - agent_goals and box_goals are lists of goals in the format (position, char, is_positive).
      See goal_description.py for further detail
    - initial_agent_positions and initial_box_positions are lists of the initial positions of agents and boxes in
      the format (position, character).
