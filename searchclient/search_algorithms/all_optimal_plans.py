    - parents: A list of parents such that we can support each node having multiple parents
    - actions: A list of all possible actions from this state.
    - optimal_actions_and_results: A map of actions into their resulting MultiParentNode.
        Note that these actions should be the subset of all possible actions, which occurs on some optimal plan.
    - consistent_goals: A set of GoalDescriptions which can contain the goal labelling.

    The implemented methods assume that the state only contains a single agent, but feel free to extend this to also
    support the multi-agent case if you so desire.
