    # In the case of "failure to find a solution" you should therefore return False, [].
    # Some useful methods on the State class which you will need to use are:
    # node.extract_plan() - Returns the list of actions used to reach this state.
    # node.get_applicable_actions(action_set) - Returns a list containing the actions applicable in the state.
    # node.result(action) - Returns the new state reached by applying the action to the current state.
    # For the GoalDescription class, you will need to use
    # goal_description.is_goal(node) - Returns true if the state is a goal state.
    # For debugging, remember that you can use print(node, file=sys.stderr) to get a representation of the state.
    # You should also take a look at the frontiers in the strategies folder to see which methods they expose
